# 📊 Internship Completion Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes **internship completion rates** to identify key success factors that influence whether students complete their internships successfully.  
The analysis is based on real-world structured data, where we evaluate metrics like:

- ✅ Enrollment numbers  
- ✅ Completion rates  
- ✅ Dropout rates  
- ✅ Department-wise trends  
- ✅ Effect of mentorship  

By combining **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** with data storytelling, this project provides actionable insights that can help institutions and mentors **improve internship success**.
